# Hey There! 
## My name’s Kevin. I’m a Boston native interested in everything from EE to robotics, to memes, to quantum computing.

I’m currently working on a radar system for UC Berkeley’s Combat Robotics team, a referee device for Ligerbots, and planning out a robotics conference for Hack For The People.

I’ll see you around ✌Hey there!

I'm Kevin, an engineer from Beantown ☘️.
