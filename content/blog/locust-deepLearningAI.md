# Project L.L.O.C.U.S.T. @ Deep Learning AI

I was contacted by Ping Wang, founder of Nova 77 and ambassador for Pie & AI @ Henderson Nevada, on the prospect of presenting Project L.L.O.C.U.S.T. to her students. I gladly accepted the offer and spent the weekend presenting the work my team did over NASA Space Apps 2020 and our roller coaster of a journey.
