# Happy Smash-O'-Tine!

In the spirit of Halloween, for the last month, my robotics team, 2877 LigerBots, and I have been working on a pumpkin smashing guillotine. Designed to mitigate the amount of carved pumpkins going into land fills, Smash-O'-Tine will obliterate, destroy, and behead pumpkins in front of the Newton Mayor @ City Hall. How amusing, having a guillotine in front of the capital of the city!

# Smash, Smash, Smash!

Smash-O'-Tine was designed with one purpose in mind, to smash, smash, smash! Standing at a towering 8ft, and pounding pumpkins with a 60 pound wooden crate, Smash-O'-Tine makes easy work on pumpkins. Like its French counterpart, its quick, clean, and effective. Nothing can survive its wrath.

# The Principle

Smash-O'-Tine can be broken down into four basic components: the structure, the smashing crate, the trigger arm, and the release system. 

## The Structure

For Smash-O'-Tine, we came up with the idea of having a box that could slide up against two rails of 2x4. The rails constrain the box's movement forward and backwards, as well as side to side. 

From this, we attached everything else.

## Smashing Crate

Consisting of multiple 2x4s, bricks, plywood, and some metal guide rails, the Smashing Crate weighs a whooping 60 lbs. While testing, we found that the 4 bricks we originally wanted as weights was too little, and thus added in 3 more layers of 4 bricks. 

The entire crate was crafted sturdily, and lasted the entire day during Pumpkin Smash. The crate was the least of our worries

## The Release System

By far the most crucial, and frankly mind numbing, component of Smash-O'-Tine is the release system. We came up with multiple mechanisms, from a pin that would be pulled out, to a electrical actuator that the crate would rest on, to eventually our final idea, a winch and a falling trigger arm. 

Because the crate weighed so much, we wanted to introduce enough mechanical advantage so our arms would not get tired after the 4+ hours of lifting. We also made it a requirement that our outreach robot, Dave, could trigger the guillotine by launching a ball.

From the start, I was a big proponent of using a winch. I had watched a video earlier that month that mentioned that one common disadvantage of using winches was that, when the ratcheting arm was released, the winch would being to freely spool because of the attached weight. But I knew this disadvantage was exactly the feature we wanted on the Smash-O'-Tine.

And thus I began the long process of explaining to the coaches and captains why a winch would be the best and safest option.

<!-- # A Month of Head Smashing

In the beginning of October, I was told by LigerBot higher ups that they needed a contraption that could smash pumpkins for our city's upcoming pumpkin fest. Two years prior, they had brought to the festival a large, 10 foot tall falling arm that had been sparsely put together in 2 days. This year, instead of putting long pieces of 2x4 together and calling it a smasher, they wanted something bolder: a device that could not only puncture holes into pumpkins, but really put the squash into pumpkin--a guillotine.

So I assembled a crew and we began cracking. Having only 4 weeks and just a few hours of shop time, Smash-O'-Tine needed a miracle.

And so began a month of head smashing. -->
