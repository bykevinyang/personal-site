# Happy Smash-O'-Tine!

In the spirit of Halloween, for the last month, my robotics team, 2877 LigerBots, and I have been working on a pumpkin smashing guillotine. Designed to mitigate the amount of carved pumpkins going into land fills, Smash-O'-Tine will obliterate, destroy, and behead pumpkins in front of the Newton Mayor @ City Hall. How amusing, having a guillotine in front of the capital of the city. 

# Smash, Smash, Smash!

Smash-O'-Tine was designed with one purpose in mind, to smash, smash, smash! Standing at a towering 8ft, and pounding pumpkins with a 60 pound wooden crate. Like its French counterpart, its quick, clean, and effective. No pumpkin can survive its wrath.

# A Month of Head Smashing

In the beginning of October, I was told by LigerBot higher ups that they needed a contraption that could smash pumpkins for our city's upcoming pumpkin fest. Two years prior, they had brought to the festival a large, 10 foot tall falling arm that had been sparsely put together in 2 days. This year, instead of putting long pieces of 2x4 together and calling it a smasher, they wanted something bolder: a device that could not only puncture holes into pumpkins, but really put the squash into pumpkin--a guillotine.

So I assembled a crew and we began cracking. With only 4 weeks and a few hours of shop time, I knew that this would be no easy feat.
